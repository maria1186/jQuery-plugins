# Basic-jQuery-Accordion-Slider-Plugin-Handy-Accordion
## Updated version

My idea to write modern code working with the latest version of jQuery.

## What did I improve?

- I added let 
- I added responsive style and deleted unused css
- I wrote comments in English because they were in Chinese
- I added a separate js file to initialize the plugin

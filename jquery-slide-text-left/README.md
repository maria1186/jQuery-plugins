## Updated of version jquery-slide-text-left

My idea is for the plugin to be compatible with the latest version of the jQuery.

## What did I improve?

- I added let 
- I added new animation
- I added a separate css file (for future project upgrade)

jQuery plugin for animating through an array of strings
